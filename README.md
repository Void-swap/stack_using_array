# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Implement a stack using an array and perform the following operations:<br>

1. <b>Push:<b> Add an element to the top of the stack.<br>
2. <b>Pop:<b> Remove and return the element from the top of the stack.<br>
3. <b>Peek:<b> Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it.<br>
4. <b>isEmpty:<b> Check if the stack is empty.<br>
5. <b>isFull:<b> Check if the stack is full.<br>

Ensure that your stack has a maximum capacity specified when initializing it.
<br>
<br>
# EXAMPLE
For example, given a stack with a capacity of 5, perform the following operations:<br>
1. Push elements 10, 20, 30 onto the stack.<br>
2. Pop an element from the stack.<br>
3. Push elements 40, 50 onto the stack.<br>
4. Peek at the top element.<br>
5. Check if the stack is empty.<br>
6. Check if the stack is full.<br>
Write a program to simulate these operations and display the state of the stack after each operation.
